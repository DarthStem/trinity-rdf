# Overview
Trinity RDF is an application development platform for Microsoft .NET and Mono. It allows to 
easily build knowledge graph applications based on the [RDF Metadata Standard](https://www.w3.org/RDF/) 
issued by the [World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)](https://w3.org).

## Benefits
Because Trinity RDF is based on open standard technology your data will be vendor-independent 
and easily exchangable in many years to come. Compared to many propriety graph databases, it 
has some considerable advantages:

* ### Standardized Graph Data Model
  The World Wide Web Consortium is an independent organization which standardizes internet technology
  such as HTML, CSS, SVG and many more. RDF technology has been continously developed and supported
  since 2001 and will be receiving support in the long term future. This means your data will be
  accessible and exchangable in decades.

* ### SPARQL Query Language
  Trinity RDF builds on the standardized [SPARQL](https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/REC-sparql11-overview-20130321/) 
  query language for graph databases. It is by design very similar to SQL and therefore very easy to learn. 
  In contrast to the query languages of many property graph databases such as [Neo4J](https://neo4j.com), 
  SPARQL is vendor independent and supported by a variety of database systems.

* ### Ontologies
  In RDF, ontologies provide powerful and flexible means for describing data structures such as classes, 
  properties and primitive data types. Because ontologies are also stored in RDF, they are independent of 
  the data they describe and can be updated during application runtime.

* ### Logical Inferencing
  When compared to traditional data modelling frameworks such as UML, ontologies allow you to define 
  inheritance relationships not only for classes but also for properties. Thea also offer more advanced
  features modelling features such as stating the equality of objects and transitivity of properties. Many 
  RDF databases can make use of logical reasoning during application runtime to answer queries about
  facts which have not been explicitly saved. This is very powerful in data integration and business
  intelligence scenarios.
